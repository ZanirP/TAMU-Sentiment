"Watching big-money football teams strategically nudge their way to the top 🤨 fouls confidence shattered n the less advantaged team stands no chance.

I was so nervous about this game. I love this coach. We got ourselves a football dude. He’s got this team firing on all cylinders. Weigman is lights out. Moss is a stud. These receivers are catching everything and this defense has a death grip on the Tiger’s throat.,Sat Oct 05 17:11:46 +0000 2024,0,0

"@TrueMIZTigers TAMU has more SEC wins in football than Mizzou since they both joined... and TAMU was playing the SEC West. Don't think its super close between the two programs, especially when you consider the fact that Mizzou had some troubles with recruiting violations during that time too.",Thu Oct 03 00:50:28 +0000 2024,2,0
